Darling, I can show you where my love hides
It's a heart beat
On a hard drive
Yeah, I'm dancing with your soul in my sights
It's a showdown
In the spotlight

Honey, glamour's got me out of my mind
Like a kill switch
On my backside
And the camera's got you frozen in time
Like a save state
In a game file
